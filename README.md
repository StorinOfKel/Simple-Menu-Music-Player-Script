# Simple-Menu-Music-Player-Script

SMMPS is actually nothing more but a BASH script allowing you to listen to music.
The dependencies are: YouTube-DL (prefered from their source), FFMPEG and a *nix based shell and last but not least: MPV

Keep in mind, as it is now, it's just a simple script without much content.

TODO:

Add more stuff, including from my own server, to play series, music, etc.
